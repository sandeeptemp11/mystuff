As the instructor wants the question paper even tougher he told that for solving question i (1 <= i <= n) there are ti( 0 <= ti <= n-1) questions needed to be solved first.
(Note that among the ti questions the question i will not be there). Help the students to find the minimum number of questions to be solved to pass the exam. If it is not possible to 
pass the exam print -1.
